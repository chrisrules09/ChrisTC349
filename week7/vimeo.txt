Vimeo is beautifully designed website that uses techniques to make you feel like your entering a new world rather just a website. Social networks usually like to create a space on the internet where you're escaping the reality and entering reality in a new way, so just with it's first page it's on the right track.

The site first off has a basic beginning screen that is typical to most social network type websites, but if you scroll down you learn there is much more to understand from the site. Upon hovering over the links at the top of the page gives you options of different subsections of the main sections and when clicking the links it bring you to pages that organized in a way that you comprehend the information that's being told.

The design of the site very nice, especially since they have so much text on one page, but with the right amount of spacing, color scheme that shows clear definition of sections, and organization of information it all works out. The videos are the main piece of the website and what I like about the video players is that they don't have borders and just seem like you're entering a new world right on your screen.
