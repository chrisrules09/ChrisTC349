First impression of HappyCog.com is that I loved the unexpected color scheme. The color scheme already makes me happy and echoes what the sites meaning embodies. I loved the typeface because it looks like old 1950s advertisements. The negative space and kerning between the typeface seem to make the website very appealing to the eye as well.

The website is one long page and the organization of the links are really cool. I really like when clicking the link you can see the web page kind of automatically scroll to that piece of the page for you. Each link has their own distinct category with a description of what the category is and the information about what the site offers in those categories. In the work section there are grayed out links to certain examples of what kind of work they have done and when you hover over it they become color, which is a nice way to show interaction with page as well.

Overall HappyCog.com is a very well designed site that is very simple and straight forward that uses great color schemes and organization.
