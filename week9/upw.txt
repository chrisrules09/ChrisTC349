United Pixelworkers is a very simple, but effective and visually organized well. The website was very cohesive all throughout and kept the same elements on each page. The large elements such as the search bar, shopping cart icon, title texts made the website feel very user-friendly and made the most used tools on the site very easy to see. The large "x's" on the items that weren't in stock made for seeing easily what wasn't available.

The visual cohesiveness is what really like about the site. Even though the main part of the site is the shopping session the other parts have to feel like they flow as well even though the format is changed. The main shopping part uses a simple square grid to display the inventory, but the job and blog sessions keep an invisible grid so that it all looks lined up as well. 

My only gripe about this website is that the main page gets kind of hard to tell what block is connecting with other blocks for information and feels random that the twitter and email subscription bar is right in the middle of the page. I think this could easily be fixed by giving a little bit more space from the main bigger squares from the few featured inventory pieces they have below.
