Jason Santa Maria's Website
jasonsantamaria.com

This website is very well designed using simple text and layout with a very nice punch color for contrast. Because the layout of the website has a strong structure he was able to fit a lot of information into tiny spaces without making the pages feel claustrophobic. He built his structure from having a good grid system layout.

The general information at the bottom of each pages is highlighted in black for contrast and was a great way to have branding along his website for anyone who would be more interested in him. 

Jason's website is pretty great from a design standpoint it's visually pleasing to the eye and the functionality is great too with the subcategories to choose from to get to specific information.
