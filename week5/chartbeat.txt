Chartbeat

Chartbeat is a website that is trying to take something that is very boring and full of numbers and make them interesting and easier to understand. The site uses scrolling as it's way to advertise what the website does without having to click links to different pages. While you scroll down the pages it has elements of design movement, which starts to look like science gears moving and statistical numbers counting down. 

The color scheme is very well done with the many different hues of blues and contrast of the red punch color for the use of buttons. Lastly the black part of the website at the bottom for a end of the site that links the user to more information on the creators, how to sign up, and how to get in touch with them.

I believe the site is very well designed for the hard to understand statistics, but made simple for anyone to read and be able to understand. The website also is based on taking this simplicity to social networks and games, which the site also holds a theme very similar to a social network.
