	<h1>Final Project Website Card Sorting</h1>
	<h2>Design Goal</h2>
    <p>My Goal with this website is to create a site that has a lot of negative space for the text to look free and have the organization to be able for the users to find their way around. My website will be about branding myself and allowing visitors to come to the website to see my style, who I am, my resume, and my work as a student, artist, and writer.</p>

	<h2>Card Sorting Table</h2>

	<h2>Description of Process</h2>
    <p>I want this website to represent whoI am, by displaying a lot of information about me in a way that is organized and not scatterbrained. When creating my cards I just incorporated everything that I wanted to share on my website and then categorized them by the grouping you see now. I had my friends also organize the cards to groups as well adn I got mostly the same organization. I made changes and incorporated what looked to be the best organization.</p>
