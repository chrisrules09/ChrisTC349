	<h2>Description of Process</h2>
    <p>I noticed there was a difference in my grouping because it came from a more information based standpoint. I gathered the information I saw on the site and grouped them into specific section, but some things on websites can't neccessarily be grouped into such broad groups. Such as social media where these ideas I put into the table need to be put onto the website, but because these sites are so well recognized they don't need to be grouped into social media page. It could be more helpful for people who are new to social websites.</p>
    <p> What I saw from my friends putting the site together through the content cards I kept noticing similiar results with the categories from the gathering of information on the cards. Many of them have never designed a website either, but this is the way they said they would understand the website.</p>
