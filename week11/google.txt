I'm reviewing Google.com from my mobile website, because it is my most frequent used website on my phone. Goole first off keeps the look of the original desktop by keeping the color scheme and simple layout. Since the site is based around search results it keeps the search bar and tabs for other options at the top of the page and as you scroll down just the results because that is the bulk of the site.

Google is one of the best mobile sites only because even though the site main function is to display search results it also displays options like directions and movie times based on what you are searching and sometimes will lead you to an even more mobile friendly app, such as Google maps to do whatever function you need. Google even, if you allow, uses your location from your phones GPS to tailor your results to where you are, which really comes in handy when you're looking for a auto repair shop in the area you're in.

Overall Google.com for mobile has a nicely tailored site for mobile that keeps elements from the desktop site to be able to feel as if it still that same sigh, but just on your mobile device. The use of other applications already installed on phones to take out of a browser and into an even more mobile experience by using apps.
