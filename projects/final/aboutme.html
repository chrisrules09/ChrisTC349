    	<p>I'm from Flint, MI and grew up in a city that was on an economic downward spiral, but I wasn't aware of this as a child. I never didn't see opportunities and just always wanted to be the best at everything I could be.</p>
        <p>In school I academically soared, but socially I had a hard time, which is something most young kids go through. I was teased and bullied for many reasons, but through extra-curricular activities such as sports and fine arts I found a way to express myself.</p>
        <p>I attended elementary at Manley Elementary, middle school at Whittier Junior High, high school at Flint Central High School, and my Undergraduate currently at Michigan State University.</p>
