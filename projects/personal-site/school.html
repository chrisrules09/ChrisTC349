    <h3>Major</h3>
<p>I'm currently a Senior working towards my Bachelors in <b>Media Arts and Technology</b>. Media Arts and Technology is within the College of Communication Arts and Sciences.</p>
    <p>My degree concentration is in Website and Video Game Design. I plan on using my degree for more website related things.</p> 
    <h3>Growth</h3>
<p>I started as <b>Studio Art</b> major and my concentration was in Graphic Design, but I realized that wasn't something I was passionate about. I kept an aspect of it in my degree though by adding a <b>Design Specialization</b> into my current degree.</p>
