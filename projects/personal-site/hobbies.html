    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>Music has always been a huge influence in my life, especially since my dad was DJ and I grew up hearing him playing music. Since growing older I've explored my own types of music and found love in music in many different ways, such as fine arts. Through music I found new love through dance and singing and through theater I was able to do both sometimes.</p>
    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <p>Growing up I watched my grandma cooked and grew inspired to be just like her when it came to cooking. As I grre older I began to experiment with recipes and became a great cook. I took more of a liking to baking though. I thought I wanted to be a chef during high school, but that aspiration was quickly focused on something else when I realized I wouldn't like doing that for the rest of my life.</p>
    <h2>Friends</h2>
    <p>My friends become an hobby when they are one of my favorite part of my days. I made my main friends in high school and this still hasn't changed. We like to do spontaneous things.</p>
