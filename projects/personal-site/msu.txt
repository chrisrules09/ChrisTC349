MSU Homepage

The MSU homepage website is designed very nicely the information it wants to share. Since the website is for a University it still has to have a professional standard look, but while still keeping it fresh with a more modern feel. 

The website uses a light legible typeface, a good amount of negative space, and a great color palate. The drop shadow under the top banner helps you recognize that information below it is the main content.

It's clear what areas are clickable, the big flash space is great for a good news piece for important information. Other news is right under, but in smaller text and pictures giving the site some great hierarchy. I love the new Twitter feed feature as well making it seem as if the site is always displaying news real-time.
