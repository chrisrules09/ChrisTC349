<h2>Website Review</h2>

<p><a href="http://panic.com/"> Panic.com</a></p>

<p>Panic.com website is very well designed and has very great interactivity. The website has a lot of negative space and a beautiful color scheme, which is very pleasing to the eye. The text that comes up as you hover over the icons is a really great way to give people a hint that they are links to another page.</p>

<p>Once you head over to the other links there are other interactive links, such as the website having dots where it gives details of the different elements of the program that it's describing.</p>

<p>My issue with the website is that it doesn't have a strong sense of hierachy. The website has great header text and things to know what it's describing, but it when scrolling the page it gets a bit long. Some of the texts begins to hover and has too many design elements on one website sometimes.</p>
