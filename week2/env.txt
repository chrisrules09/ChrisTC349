Choosing a Development Environment

	I chose Dreamweaver, because I already have that installed onto my MacBook and i have experience in it already. It has code shortcuts already installed and the layout looks really nice.
	I did have a problem when trying to edit the README.md file, because it doesn't read that format, so I used TextMate to edit that file. For moments like that I may have to switch over to TextMate in order to edit things like that or just TextEdit.
