Heroku is visually pleasing website though the color scheme is a bit dark, so it's kind of easy to really want to read anything that is too long on the site. The texture on the background of the site is a nice touch to the design and the origami paper birds were good at describing the steps to how the cloud application platform performs.

As far as hierarchy I kind of get lost on the site, because there are so many links and different services that you can get lost deep in the site really easily. When going to the Heroku Postgress link I didn't like the fact that the site changed color schemes to a blue rather than the purple color scheme, didn't feel consistent. There's just a lot of information on each page and kind of makes it easy to just skimp over things and not really pay attention to what's on the site.

I chose the one column layout, because it best fit my website. It was already in a one column system and using more columns would have been unnecessary since all the information is important to the title of each webpage and there wasn't really any secondary info to put into columns. If I add more content then it would be smart for me to use the two column layout.
