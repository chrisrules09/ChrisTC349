The MSU Mobile site is very well designed to match the branding of the school, very mobile phone friendly, and even customizable. Basically MSU Mobile site is everything you would want it a mobile site. 

First off the site uses the theme of MSU by keeping the colors scheme and logo for branding purposes and to feel consistent with the desktop site. Then from those elements it uses big graphic icons for links to parts of the website, which is what we are used to on phones to easily tap and access applications. When reaching areas like calendar or athletics it has big touch fields to reach it's subcategories. It also implements other applications like Google Maps and Youtube to allow use to get directions or watch videos

The MSU Mobile site is so well designed and doesn't feel comprised for being a mobile site. It feels as if I'm still getting the same information, maps, videos, and databases I would get from the main desktop site. The MSU Mobile website is an A+
